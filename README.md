This is a simple app to monitor the status of elevators in a building.

- Select an individual elevator to see its status and change its status to operational
- Return to the home screen to see the updated status of all elevators


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

- [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

- [Expo emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)


### Installation 
1.
```css
git clone git@github.com:JulienCharbonneau/Rocket-Elevators-Mobile-React-Native.git
```
2. 
```css
npm install

```

3.
```
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## Important

Port forwarding  was needed in development due to the api running locally in a different machine to the emulator .So you may need to change url in some place in code depending on how you run the associate api `git clone git@github.com:JulienCharbonneau/RestApi.git`.
